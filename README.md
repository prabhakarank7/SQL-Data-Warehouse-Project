1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, data standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema, required for reporting and analytics.


## üìñ Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold** Layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data from Source Systems into the Warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing Fact & Dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL based Reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
